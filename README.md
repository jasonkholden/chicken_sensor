A detailed project writeup is available at [Making Electronics](http://makingelectronics.com/?q=node/3) on how to use this board to build a solar-powered IoT Temperature sensor

This daughter board will multiplex up to 4 10k thermistor inputs to the
1V-max ADC of the ESP8266.  The current form factor targets the Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266 Breakout footprint
